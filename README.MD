# Hospital Management System (HMS)

## Overview
The **Hospital Management System (HMS)** is a software application developed to manage various aspects of hospital operations. It is designed to streamline processes such as user authentication, medical record management, and inventory control. This project is part of the NTU SC2002 course.

### Documentation
You can access the project documentation, including JavaDoc, [here](https://github.com/YellowO2/HospitalManagementSystem/tree/main/doc).

### Assumptions
- The system assumes a valid dataset for initialization, including users, medical records, and inventory data.
- User roles (e.g., Doctor, Patient, Administrator) are predefined and cannot be dynamically created within the system.
- All database operations are simulated using CSV files to emulate persistent storage.
- The system operates as a console-based application with no graphical user interface.
